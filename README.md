## 📝 Risk Story Summary  
Our Bowtie diagram explains what can happen when a driver loses control of a car on the highway.  
We show what things can cause this to happen (fatigue, bad weather, road hazards), the steps that help prevent the accident,  
and the steps that reduce the damage if the accident does happen (like emergency response or crash-avoidance systems).

Our goal is to make the risk story extremely simple and easy for anyone to follow.
